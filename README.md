# NFT with Test and through some automatic analysis tools

## Introduction
This project is the NFT project with Testing and automatic analysis tools. It is built based on my [previous NFT project](https://github.com/pinkyTseng/NftTruffle1), adding complete test cases written by myself and trying to utilize some more popular automatic analysis tools for smart contracts to enhance contract security. The security of smart contracts is crucial. The project includes complete test cases with high coverage, you can see the picture below. Some analysis tools I tried included Slither(Static Analysis), Echidna(Fuzzing), Manticore(Symbolic Execution), and Mythril. Some automatic analysis tool has their specific limitations, such as the files need to be flattened or the solidity compiler should be some specific version. The monitorContract directory is created to place the files which use to execute the analysis tools. Due to the monitorContract directory mainly including some files generated by the program and some files just for a simple test, many files in the directory are a little messy.

## Conclution
Through the project, I practice writing test cases to achieve high code coverage to enhance the security of the contract. Slither runs fast and gives some advice, I modify the more critical parts according to the suggestions Slither gives. Echinda through executes a pseudo-random generation of transactions to test the specific properties we defined or whether some assertion happened.

There are some situations I encountered when I try with Manticore and Mythril. Manticore works well with the lower solc version, but now the solidity version is 8.X.X. I try to replace the solc version to 8.X.X of the container and run the analysis python code I wrote, it can be run but the result is different from my expectations, so Manticore runs with a high solc version may have some problems. When I execute the Mythril, if I don't set the --max-depth argument it will run over than 1hr still not finished. When I set the --max-depth argument, it will be finished in several minutes. Since this is my first time trying these tools, please let me know if I missed something, thanks.
